    Start out by creating an empty HTML page with the HTML starter code
    Create 2-3 <div> elements in the <body> section of the HTML, one for each student
    Inside each <div>
        Create a header (either <h1>, <h2>, etc) with the student's name
        Under the header, create an anchor tag that links to the student's GitHub page
        Under the link, add an image of the student
        And finally, create an ordered list that contains a list item for each question and answer
            Each question and answer should be stored in a single list item element (<li>)
